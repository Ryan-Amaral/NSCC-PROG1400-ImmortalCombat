A project for an Intro to Object Oriented Programming class at NSCC. This program is a basic fighting game where you can upgrade your character's armor and weapon. The stats are rolled at the beginning and left as is. There is a shop to buy new weapons and armors by using points won from battles, weapons and armors add a boost to attack and defence. The battles are randomly rolled, but influenced by stats and weapons, criticals can happen too. The opponent leaves a funny message at the end of the battle for you. There are three different difficulties of battles, the more difficult ones give a greater point reward.
